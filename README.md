# lua-to-bytecode

Converts lua code into `bytecode` which can be passed onto other functions and decoded as well.

# purpose?

nothing. just pure bytecode. converts into some cool encoding process! to decode use unloader.

# for what?

You can make some special 'Bytecode' execution [which was my idea like 2 years ago].
